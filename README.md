## Projects

### Statistics
 * [University Towns Hypothesis](https://github.com/Sukhrat/Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/master/Mini-Projects/UniversityTowns-Hypothesis) - used Python and its libraries to conduct a Hypothesis testing
 
### Web Scraping
 * [Presidential Elections](https://github.com/Sukhrat/Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/master/Mini-Projects/Presidential%20Elections) Used Python libraries to scrape the Kazakhstan Presidential elections participation data from Wikipedia to check the relationship between salary and elections attendance  

### Data Visualization
 * [Kazakhstan Salaries by Region](https://github.com/Sukhrat/Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/master/Mini-Projects/KZ%20income) Used Python with Bokeh and Geopandas libraries to visualize Salary distribution by regions in Kazakhstan
### Data Cleaning
 * Patient coma prediction - based on small and unsorted real-world patient data, had to predict whether or not given patient will have a coma. Applied boosting algorithms and got 72% accuracy.

### Machine Learning
  * [Job Prestige]() built a  regression model that evaluates how prestigous the specific job title is
  * [Customer Churn Prediction](https://github.com/Sukhrat/Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/master/Mini-Projects/Customer%20Churn) - used Python and Logistic Regression to model a prediction on customer churn on Telecommunication company database.
  * [Online store product recommender]() - based on the online store purchase data from UCI repository, used turicreate library to build a collaborative filtering model based on cosine similarity
  

### Deep Learning
 * [Cat Identifier](https://github.com/Sukhrat/Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/master/Mini-Projects/Cat-ID) - as a final project on "Neural Networks and Deep Learning" course on Coursera, using Python trained an algorithm to identify a cat on the image
 * [Movie Genre classification] - using Keras built a model to identify the genre of the movie by its poster
 * [Tesla stock analysis] - performed different time-series analysis techniques to build several deep learning models for Tesla Company's stock historical data
