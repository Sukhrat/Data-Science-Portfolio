## Experience
**Graduate Thesis Research**
Real Options Pricing using Neural Networks

* Applied ANN to build a new model that overcomes volatility assumptions in Black-Scholes model
* Interpreted the numerical results for the real business usage

**PDE solver using Neural Networks**
## Projects

### Statistics
 * [University Towns Hypothesis](https://github.com/Sukhrat/Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/master/Mini-Projects/UniversityTowns-Hypothesis) - used Python and its libraries to conduct a Hypothesis testing
 
### Web Scraping
 * [Presidential Elections](https://github.com/Sukhrat/Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/master/Mini-Projects/Presidential%20Elections) Used Python libraries to scrape the Kazakhstan Presidential elections participation data from Wikipedia to check the relationship between salary and elections attendance  

### Data Visualization
 * [Kazakhstan Salaries by Region](https://github.com/Sukhrat/Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/master/Mini-Projects/KZ%20income) Used Python with Bokeh and Geopandas libraries to visualize Salary distribution by regions in Kazakhstan
### Data Cleaning
 * Patient coma prediction - based on small and unsorted real-world patient data, had to predict whether or not given patient will have a coma. Applied boosting algorithms and got 72% accuracy.

### Machine Learning
  * [Titanic Disaster](https://github.com/Sukhrat/Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/master/Mini-Projects/Titanic) - used Python to preprocess the data and used Logistic Regression to predict survival on Titanic Disaster. Got 78% prediction accuracy.
  * [Customer Churn Prediction](https://github.com/Sukhrat/Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/master/Mini-Projects/Customer%20Churn) - used Python and Logistic Regression to model a prediction on customer churn on Telecommunication company database.
  

### Deep Learning
 * [Cat Identifier](https://github.com/Sukhrat/Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/master/Mini-Projects/Cat-ID) - as a final project on "Neural Networks and Deep Learning" course on Coursera, using Python trained an algorithm to identify a cat on the image
